# Face-Mask-Detection
A Face Mask Detection Model using CNN.

In this Deep Learining Project a Face Mask Detector Model is build using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
The model can be used to identify if a person is wearing a mask or not.
The data set used is available on kaggle.
Some of the libraries used are:
1) Tensorflow
2) Keras
3) PIL
4) Matplotlib
5) CV
6) Numpy
7) zipfile
